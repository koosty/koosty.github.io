My name is Kustian, pronounced like `Koosty`. A bit of my backgrounds:

- I live in [Konoha](https://en.tempo.co/read/1815556/the-reasons-why-indonesian-netizens-call-their-country-konoha).
- I work as a Software Engineer.
- I love to talk about Tech, Culture, and Society.

### My story

Living in [Konoha](https://en.tempo.co/read/1815556/the-reasons-why-indonesian-netizens-call-their-country-konoha) can be both a blessing and a curse, and I choose the latter. Why? Because being born as a commoner, I have to struggle more than the nobles. Living under a curse makes you aware that nothing should be taken for granted.

I earned my college degree through the hardest path imaginable; you could say I was a slave at that time(literally). However, it was that pain and discomfort that shaped me into who I am today.

My first job as a Software Engineer felt like taking on a quest as an [Adventurer](https://overlordmaruyama.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer). There was no contract, no direct contact with the employerâ€”just show up on-site and get the job done.

I view the world as a river. Should I flow with the current or swim against it? Naturally, I choose the latter.
